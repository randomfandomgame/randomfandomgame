            <p> Random Fandom Game is made by someone with way too much time on their hands and not nearly enough coding skills. Data taken from <a href= "https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/18804">this AO3 data dump </a>from March 21, 2021 as put together by <a href = "https://toastystats.tumblr.com/">ToastyStats</a> <a href = "https://destinationtoast.tumblr.com/"> (destinationtoast) </a>on Tumblr. <a href = "https://destinationtoast.tumblr.com/post/649396656813604864/easier-access-to-ao3-data-dump"> Their post </a>contains easier to manage spreadsheets as well as information about the caveats of the data. Also, the tags included in this game are in no way representative of the Archive as a whole. Tags are included or excluded to provide the best experience for the most amount of people. Random Fandom Game is not affiliated with AO3 or the OTW. </p>
