            <p> Random Fandom Game is made by someone with way too much time on their hands and not nearly enough coding skill. 
                Data has been collected using <a href= "https://github.com/fandomstats/toastystats">this data scraper </a> as created by <a href = "https://toastystats.tumblr.com/">ToastyStats</a> 
                <a href = "https://destinationtoast.tumblr.com/"> (destinationtoast)</a> on Tumblr. 
                   Current tags consist of popular additional tags, as well as top character and fandom tags, 
                   as typically seen in the AO3 filter sidebar. 
                    This has been modified slightly in cases where the same character or relationship is known under several names. 
                    Data was collected August 2023. Earlier versions of the game used data from March 2021, and included bookmark tags in the count, which accounts for discrepancies. 
                    Current data is scraped from the tag's webpage, so counts reflect the number you would typically see on a tag's page. 
                    Also, the tags included in this game are in no way representative of the Archive as a whole. 
                    Tags are included or excluded to provide the best experience for the most amount of people. 
                    Random Fandom Game is not affiliated with AO3 or the OTW. <br> <br> @randomfandomgame on TikTok and <a href = "https://randomfandomgame.tumblr.com/" >Tumblr.</a></p>
